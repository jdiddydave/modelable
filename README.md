# modelable
Testing the LW3 modelable feature

Here is using `Form::class` and `Input::class`

https://github.com/jdiddydave/modelable/assets/98569588/f4aac491-2abd-4846-9c08-57c962f5d667

Added two more examples:

1. TodoList and TodoInput (from LW docs)
2. ParentComponent and ChildComponent

Each seems to need a `wire:click="foo"` on the Parent to display the Child Value.
